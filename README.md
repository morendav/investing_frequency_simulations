# Investing Frequency & Historical Returns

Given two investors: one investing all of their annual target investment in January, and the other investing at some subannual frequency (e.g. monthly, quarterly, etc), which one wins at the end of the investments’ time-horizon?

This blog post explores whether investment frequency (yearly, monthly, etc) has any effect on portfolio performance. 

When it comes to investing either all upfront (front-loading) or distributing across the year (monthly, quarterly, biannually), historical data suggests that front-loading is the winning strategy.
- This is true for market indexes (e.g. SP500)
- This is also true for high volatility assets (e.g. High Beta indexes and Bitcoin)

Summary of observations:

- For the SP500
   - The investor that invests in January outperforms the monthly, quarterly, and biannual investor over the long term (30yr term)
   - Short-term investing produces a wider range of outcomes (yearly vs sub-annual investing), but the data suggests that January Investing is still more likely to outperform sub-annual investing
   - The data suggests that of the sub-annual investing strategies: Monthly outperforms Quarterly, and Quarterly outperforms biannual investing.
       - This is likely an outcome of the case study’s implementation because the quarterly investor starts on month 3, biannual on month 6, and monthly on month 1.
       - In other words, quarterly misses investing in months [1, 2]. This supports the hypothesis that time in the market is a source of investment performance.
- For high Beta assets
   - We see the same outcomes as the SP500 (yearly > monthly > quarterly > biannual performance)
   - There is a wider range of observed outcomes when we look at short-term investing
- For Bitcoin
   - We see the same outcomes as the SP500
